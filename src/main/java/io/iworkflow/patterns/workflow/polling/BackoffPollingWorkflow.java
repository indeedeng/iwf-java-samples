/**
 * A workflow implementation that utilizes an exponential backoff strategy for polling an external dependency.
 * <p>This workflow is designed to handle scenarios where an external system or service may not be immediately available,
 * and repeated attempts with increasing intervals are necessary to achieve a successful interaction.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Workflow Overview</h2>
 * <p>The Backoff Polling Workflow consists of the following states:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>ReadExternalDepState</b>: The initial state that attempts to read from an external dependency.
 *       It employs a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle transient failures.</li>
 *   <li><b>PollingCompleteState</b>: The final state that completes the workflow once the external dependency
 *       has been successfully accessed and processed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Retry Strategy</h2>
 * <p>The workflow uses an exponential backoff strategy for efficiently managing retries by
 * gradually increasing the wait time between attempts, thereby reducing the load on the
 * external system and improving the chances of a successful interaction.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>To start the Backoff Polling Workflow, use the following REST endpoint:</p>
 * <pre>
 * GET /design-pattern/polling/start/backoff?workflowId={workflowId}
 * </pre>
 * <p>This endpoint initiates the workflow with the specified {@code workflowId}.</p>
